# apery
A formal proof of the irrationality of zeta(3), the Ap√©ry constant.

The development compiles with Coq v.10.1 and depends on libraries Mathematical Components and CoqEAL. In its current version,
CoqEAL also depend on Bignums, Param and SsrMultinomials.

[Here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06611) is the companion paper to this formal proof.
