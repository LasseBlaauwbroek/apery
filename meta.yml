synopsis: >-
  A formally verified proof, by computer algebra, that ζ(3) is irrational.

description: |-
  This project contains a formal proof that the real number zeta(3),
  also known as Apéry's constant, is irrational. It follows roughly
  Apéry's original sketch of a proof. However, the recurrence
  relations constituting the crux of the proof have been guessed by a
  computer algebra program (in this case in Maple/Algolib). These
  relations are formally checked a posteriori, so that Coq's kernel
  remains the sole trusted code base.
